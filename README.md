## toddler-travel

Toddler Travel is the start of a web app and eventually native (iPad) app for my daughter to learn more about global cultures.

The eventual goal will allow her, or my wife and I, to select multiple countries for a vacation. Once the countries are selected, she will start her trip and visit each country (with the intent to learn about the countries cultures).

Current Status: start to a long term side project (She's only 5 months now, so have a little while).
